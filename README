Unalarming
==========

This is a simple iOS verison of the meditation alarm that I wrote for Android.  It is not feature complete with the Android version (for example, it does not block phone class like the Android version). 

I present this as a simple step toward learning Objective-C, Cocoa Touch/iOS, and Xcode.  If you see anything glaring or generally stupid - please feel free to comment and educate me on my mistake.  I want to be as idiomatic as possible (as soon as possible). 

## Future Work 

* Add subview animation for the selection dialog view

* Add alarm reminder to the notification/status bar 

Cheers!
