Unalarming
==========

This is a simple iOS verison of the meditation alarm that I wrote for Android.  It is not feature complete with the Android version (for example, it does not block phone class like the Android version). 

I present this as a simple step toward learning Objective-C, Cocoa Touch/iOS, and Xcode.  If you see anything glaring or generally stupid - please feel free to comment and educate me on my mistake.  I want to be as idiomatic as possible (as soon as possible). 

## Future Work 

* Add subview animation for the selection dialog view

* Add alarm reminder to the notification/status bar 

## Thanks

I had goofed up that vibration code so that it wouldn't beep on an iPod Touch.  It turned out that the platform as an elegant solution that I found [here] (http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/coding/iphone-tutorial-better-way-to-check-capabilities-of-ios-devices/) in this blog. Thanks Mugunth Kumar (I tracked that link down from this StackOverflow [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4724980/making-the-iphone-vibrate). 

Cheers!
